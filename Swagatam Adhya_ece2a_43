                                                       MY REVIEW ON  BUILD YOUR BASE DEV TOOLS 101 SESSION

It was really an interesting and quite knowledgeable 2 days session on Linux Operating System,Github and Command Line Interface.The fluency and the way of delivery of the speakers made the topic not only easy to understand but also ignited the motivation to know more about the topic.I came to know a lot about repositories,collaboration features,access control,wikis and basic task management tools.I also came to know about Vim text editor and it’s smooth and efficient working facilities.The way in which the speakers made us familiar with the commands in text editor through screen sharing was indeed the best way to learn a new software.I also gained a lot of insight about Git Bash and the various Git commands used while committing to a repository through the command line Interface.I also came to know about the process of creation and deletion of files in Linux Mate.This was the first time I became familiar with Linux and its various distributions.Linux command terminal is more efficient for bash scripting and has lots of packages and libraries in it’s various distribution.I also learned how to make a new branch of an existing repository by forking it and also the various types of additions and deletions that we can do through committing changes in the forked repository through the graphic user interface.
