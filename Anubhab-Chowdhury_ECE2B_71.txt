Review for ByB Dev Tools 101 session1:
The session throughout was really informative and well conducted.
Everything was easy to learn and really covered from basic which was a great thing to notice.
Explanation to each chapter was really clear and also some extra knowledge and points were taught to us which was another good thing to consider.
Another important thing was that the whole thing was finished on perfect time duration, the puntuality was amazing.
Overall this session will help us a lot with the basics of several important dev tools and it was a lot of fun!
